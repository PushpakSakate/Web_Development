    <p>Maharashtra this one word says it all.
        From Bollywood to Dharavi, from Mumbai to Pune, from Ganpatipule to Marine drive, from Badlapur to Bandra and
        from Siddhivinayak to Mt. Mary.
        Popularly known for its dream city Mumbai, Maharashtra is probably the most diverse as well as balanced states
        in India.<br>
        Maharashtra is home to a number of beaches that are definitely worth a visit.
        Kashid, Ganpatiplue, Alibaug, Tarkarli, Dapoli and Harihareshwar are a few beaches that simply add up to the
        pristine beauty of this state.<br>
        The natives of the state are known as Maharashtrians and despite the large variety of food available here, the
        local dishes and cuisine is utterly delicious.
        Misal pav, Pitla Bhakri, Vada Pav, Puran Poli and Rassa are a few dishes you must try out for sure if youâ€™ve
        decided to venture the local cuisine of Maharashtra.<br>
        One of the most important factors of a place is its geographical location,
        situated in the western coast of India, Maharashtra does not only shelter some of the finest weekend getaway
        destinations such as
        Lonavala, Igatpuri, Matheran, Karjat, Mahabaleshwar and Amboli but is also close to many other states that are
        easily accessible through rail, road and air.
